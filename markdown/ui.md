# User Interface

_An example of French learning session_

The UI should be quite straightforward, and resemble a standard chat. Here are some additional 
useful functionalities available:

* **Recording**: You are able to write to your tutor text messages, but you can also talk. Click the 
recording button to begin recording (it will turn red), and once again to stop recording and process it.
The language button next to the recording button indicates the language you speak in the recording. Click it to
switch between your native language and the one you learn. There's also automatic language recognition option
(marked by 'A'), but it is less recommended, as processing might take longer and might be more prone to errors.
* **Download chat history**: Will be saved as a JSON file.
* **Bot reciting**: Clicking this button will play the bot reciting thee text. You can also ask it to to recite
you messages, to hear how it pronounces it.
* **User recording**: If your message is based on recording, clicking this button will play your recording.
* **Translate**: Clicking this button will add translation to your tutor messages in your selected native language.
